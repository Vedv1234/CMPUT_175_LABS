# CMPUT 175 Lab Collection

Contains lab assignments and projects from my CMPUT 175 (Introduction to Foundations of Computation II) course at the University of Alberta. My labs cover fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Python, progressing from basic file operations and simple games to more complex data structure implementations. Early labs include a Caesar cipher decoder, a numerical Tic-Tac-Toe game, and browser navigation simulators that demonstrate list and stack operations. The collection also features several implementations of common data structures including queues, linked lists (both singly and doubly), and binary trees with various traversal methods.

Later labs focus on algorithmic concepts such as recursion and sorting. My recursion lab implements functions for list operations, integer division, and binary search without using iteration. The sorting lab compares performance between selection sort and merge sort on different input datasets. My binary tree lab includes methods for tree construction from traversal sequences and finding minimum/maximum values. Additionally, there are several assignments that involve practical data processing tasks, including CSV file analysis for sales transactions using both standard Python and pandas, as well as an interactive emoji carousel application I built with a circular doubly-linked list structure.
